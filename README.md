## Introduction

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart cannot pump blood effectively, leading to a range of symptoms and health issues. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart failure in patients based on their medical history and other relevant factors.

## Features

- Predicts the probability of heart failure in patients.
- Utilizes a range of machine learning algorithms.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running example notebooks)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```shell
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-failure-prediction.git
```

2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:

```shell
   pip install scikit-learn==0.22.1
```

3. Python script to Run
